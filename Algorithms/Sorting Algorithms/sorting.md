## What is Sorting?

```
A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given collection of elements, 
according to a comparision operator on the elements. The comparision operator 
is used to decide the new order of elements within the collection.
```

Let's say we are given the following dataset:
```
2, 10, 3, 9, 22, 17, 40
```

Now, if we were to sort the given elements, such that the resulting arrangement would follow a non-decreasing order, we'd get the following rearrangement;

```
2, 3, 9, 10, 17, 22, 40
```

Similarly, if we wished to obtain such an arrangement where the collection of elements (numbers) would follow a non-increasing order, we'd get the following rearrangement:

```
40, 22, 17, 10, 9, 3, 2
```

Although when we are sorting a collection of numbers, there are generally only two ways to sort them (as shown above).

But when sorting a collection of a different dataset (say a different data structure like lists/arrays), then we have more ways to sort them.
In such cases we make use of a comparision operator/function (as talked above), which returns a boolean value, depending on the comparision computation it makes on each element of the dataset.

### Sorting Algorithms
There are a variety of ways through which we can sort a given collection of numbers.
Similarly there are a variety of algorithms, which make use of different instructions/computations, to sort a given dataset.

We'll begin with the ones which are the most intuitive and proceed our way up to the ones which are the most efficient.
