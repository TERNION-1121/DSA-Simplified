# Ahoy, Matey!

Welcome to the *ðŸŒ´ DSA Archipelago ðŸŒ´* !

We shall begin our exploration of DSA Concepts from the *Algorithms Island Group.*

## Algorithms
But, what do they mean? ðŸ¤”

```
An algorithm is a procedure (set of sequential instructions), 
used for solving a problem, or performing a computation.
```

<br>

> Recall the steps to multiply two numbers.

> All these steps, when grouped sequence wise, form an algorithm, which we use repetitively to multiply numbers in our daily life.

> Another good example of an algorithm is [Euclid's Division Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/euclid-division-lemma/), which is used to compute the HCF (GCD) of two numbers.

Alright, now we know what an algorithm means, we shall explore the different islands within this island group.
